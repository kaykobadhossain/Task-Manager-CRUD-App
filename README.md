# Task-Manager-CRUD-App
 Task Description Profile-based Task Manager:  Enhance the Task Manager application by integrating MySQL database for data storage and implementing proper authentication and authorization processes to handle profile-based access control.  Note: Please use git repo for version controlling. As this one is the subsequent task of previous one. Updated Requirements:  1. Backend:    - Integrate MySQL database with the backend for storing task data.    - Use core MySQL queries (without an ORM) to interact with the MySQL database.    - Implement authentication and authorization middleware for protecting routes and ensuring proper access control.  2. Database Schema:    - Design a database schema to store user profiles and tasks. Include tables for users and tasks, with appropriate relationships (e.g., one-to-many).    - Define fields for user profiles, including username, email, password (hashed), and role (e.g., admin, regular user).    - Define fields for tasks, including title, description, status, and user ID (foreign key).  3. Authentication:    - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication.    - Provide endpoints for user registration and login.    - Hash passwords securely using bcrypt before storing them in the database.    - Issue JWT tokens upon successful authentication for subsequent requests.  4. Authorization:    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain routes based on user roles.    - Define roles such as "admin" and "user".    - Ensure that only authenticated users can access protected routes.    - Authorize users to perform CRUD operations only on their own tasks.  5. Functionality:    - Maintain the existing CRUD functionality for managing tasks.    - Enhance task creation to associate tasks with the authenticated user.    - Allow users to view, edit, and delete only their own tasks.    - Provide endpoints for viewing all tasks and filtering tasks based on status or other criteria.  6. Additional Features (Optional):    - Implement password reset functionality with email verification.    - Add validation to ensure unique usernames and email addresses during user registration.    - Implement logging and error handling middleware to track and handle server-side errors effectively.
